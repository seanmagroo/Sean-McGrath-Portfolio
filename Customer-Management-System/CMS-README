# Customer Management System
This repository contains my portion of the groupwork associated with the Customer Management System.

As previously mentioned, here are the details for this project: 

Customer Management System
Technologies: PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Description: Allows adding, amending, deleting customers and managing bookings.
Setup Instructions:
Download XAMPP or another PHP server.
Place project folder name in server root .
Access via http://localhost/yourfoldername/.

Notes
PHP project requires local server to run. It will not execute correctly if opened directly in a browser and will cause raw PHP code to appear on screen instead.
This Project was originally a collaboration with fellow students. The included files contain my portion of work contributed to this collaboration.
